## ðŸ“… Day 1: Go Fundamentals & Setup

Today is all about getting started with Go â€” from setting up your development environment to writing your very first Go program and understanding its basic building blocks.

### âœ… Content:

- **Introduction to Go:**
  - What is Go?
  - Key features: Concurrency, performance, simplicity.
  - Why it's gaining popularity.

- **Installation and Environment Setup:**
  - Install Go on **Windows**, **macOS**, or **Linux**.
  - Configure your `GOPATH` and understand its role.
  - Recommended IDEs:
    - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Go extension
    - [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/)

- **Your First Go Program:**
  - Writing and executing a simple `"Hello, World!"` application.

- **Basic Syntax and Structure:**
  - The role of `package main` and `func main()`.
  - Comments in Go: `//` for single-line, `/* */` for multi-line.

- **Variables and Basic Data Types:**
  - Declaring variables: `var` and `:=`
  - Common types:
    - Integers: `int`, `int32`, `int64`
    - Floats: `float32`, `float64`
    - Booleans: `bool`
    - Strings: `string`

---

### ðŸ’» Example Code:

```go
package main // Declares the package as 'main', making it an executable program

import "fmt" // Imports the "fmt" package for formatted I/O (e.g., printing)

func main() { // The entry point of the program
    // Your first Go program
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go World!")

    // Variable declaration and initialization
    var name string = "Alice" // Explicit type declaration
    age := 30                 // Short variable declaration (type inferred)
    height := 1.75            // float64 by default
    isStudent := false

    // Formatted output
    fmt.Printf("Name: %s, Age: %d, Height: %.2f, Is Student: %t\n", name, age, height, isStudent)
}
```
---

## ðŸ“… Day 2: Operators & Control Flow

Today, you'll delve into performing operations and controlling the execution flow of your Go programs using conditional statements and loops.

### âœ… Content:

- **Arithmetic Operators:** 
  - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo.

- **Assignment Operators:** 
  - Simple assignment (=), compound assignments (+=, -=, etc.).

- **Comparison Operators:** Greater than, less than, equal to, not equal to, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to.
- **Logical Operators:** && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT).
- **Conditional Statements (if, else if, else):** Decision-making based on conditions.
- **Looping Constructs (for):** Go's single, versatile for loop for all iteration needs (equivalent to for, while, and do-while in other languages).

---

### ðŸ’» Example Code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Arithmetic operators example
	a := 15
	b := 4
	fmt.Printf("Sum: %d\n", a+b)
	fmt.Printf("Difference: %d\n", a-b)
	fmt.Printf("Product: %d\n", a*b)
	fmt.Printf("Division: %f\n", float64(a)/float64(b)) // Type conversion for float division
	fmt.Printf("Modulo: %d\n", a%b)

	// Conditional statements example
	score := 82
	if score >= 90 {
		fmt.Println("Excellent!")
	} else if score >= 70 {
		fmt.Println("Good!")
	} else if score >= 50 {
		fmt.Println("Average.")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Needs improvement.")
	}

	// For loop example (as a traditional for loop)
	fmt.Println("\nNumbers from 0 to 4:")
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		fmt.Println(i)
	}

	// For loop example (as a while loop)
	count := 0
	fmt.Println("\nCount increments:")
	for count < 3 {
		fmt.Printf("Count: %d\n", count)
		count++
	}
}
```

---

## ðŸ“… Day 3: Composite Data Types (Arrays, Slices, Maps)

Today you'll explore Go's fundamental data structures for grouping and organizing data.

### âœ… Content:

- **Arithmetic Operators:** 
  - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo.

- **Arrays:** Fixed-size, ordered collections of elements of the same type.
  - Declaration, initialization, accessing elements.
- **Slices:** Dynamic, flexible views into arrays.
  - Creating slices, appending elements, slicing existing slices.
  - Understanding len() and cap().
- **Maps:** Unordered collections of key-value pairs (hash maps/dictionaries).
  - Creating, adding, accessing, updating, and deleting entries.
  - Checking for key existence.  

### ðŸ’» Example Code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Array example
	var numbers [5]int // Declares an array of 5 integers
	numbers[0] = 10
	numbers[1] = 20
	fmt.Println("Array:", numbers)
	fmt.Println("First element of array:", numbers[0])

	// Slice example
	fruits := []string{"apple", "orange", "banana"} // Creates a slice
	fmt.Println("\nInitial slice:", fruits)
	fruits = append(fruits, "mango") // Append elements
	fmt.Println("Slice after appending:", fruits)
	fmt.Println("Slice length:", len(fruits))
	fmt.Println("Slice capacity:", cap(fruits))

	// Slicing an existing slice
	someFruits := fruits[1:3] // Elements from index 1 (inclusive) to 3 (exclusive)
	fmt.Println("Sliced fruits (orange, banana):", someFruits)

	// Map example
	studentGrades := map[string]int{
		"Alice": 95,
		"Bob":   88,
	}
	fmt.Println("\nStudent Grades Map:", studentGrades)
	fmt.Println("Alice's grade:", studentGrades["Alice"])

	// Add a new entry
	studentGrades["Charlie"] = 77
	fmt.Println("Map after adding Charlie:", studentGrades)

	// Check if a key exists
	grade, exists := studentGrades["Bob"]
	if exists {
		fmt.Printf("Bob's grade: %d (exists: %t)\n", grade, exists)
	}

	// Delete an entry
	delete(studentGrades, "Bob")
	fmt.Println("Map after deleting Bob:", studentGrades)
}
```

## ðŸ“… Day 4: Functions & Error Handling

Today you'll learn to modularize your code with functions and gracefully handle errors, which is a core part of Go's philosophy.

### âœ… Content:


- **Functions:**
  - Defining and calling functions.
  - Parameters and return values (single and multiple return values).
  - Named return values.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Understanding Go's idiomatic error handling: returning error as the last return value.
  - Checking for errors.
  - Using _ (blank identifier) to ignore unwanted return values (including errors when appropriate, but generally not recommended for errors).
- **defer Statement:** Scheduling a function call to be executed just before the surrounding function returns.

### ðŸ’» Example Code:

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

// Simple function
func greet(name string) {
	fmt.Printf("Hello, %s!\n", name)
}

// Function with single return value
func calculateSum(num1, num2 int) int {
	return num1 + num2
}

// Function with multiple return values and error handling
func divide(numerator, denominator float64) (float64, error) {
	if denominator == 0 {
		return 0, errors.New("cannot divide by zero")
	}
	return numerator / denominator, nil // nil means no error
}

func main() {
	greet("Go Learner")

	sum := calculateSum(10, 15)
	fmt.Printf("Sum of 10 and 15: %d\n", sum)

	// Error handling example
	result, err := divide(10.0, 2.0)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error during division: %s\n", err.Error())
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("Result of division (10/2): %.2f\n", result)
	}

	result, err = divide(10.0, 0.0) // This will cause an error
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error during division: %s\n", err.Error())
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("Result of division (10/0): %.2f\n", result)
	}

	// Defer statement example
	fmt.Println("\nStarting main function")
	defer fmt.Println("Main function finished") // This will run last
	fmt.Println("Doing some work...")
}
```

---

## ðŸ“… Day 5: Structs, Pointers & Methods

Today you'll learn about creating custom data types, working with memory addresses, and defining behaviors for your custom types.

### âœ… Content:


- **Structs:** Custom composite data types for grouping related fields.
  - Defining structs.
  - Creating struct instances and accessing fields.
  - Nested structs.
- **Pointers:** Variables that store memory addresses of other variables.
  - Declaring pointers, dereferencing (*), and taking address (&).
  - When to use pointers (passing by reference, modifying values).
- **Methods:** Functions associated with a specific type (structs).
  - Receiver functions (value receivers vs. pointer receivers).

### ðŸ’» Example Code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Define a Person struct
type Person struct {
	Name string
	Age  int
	City string
}

// Define a method for the Person struct (value receiver)
func (p Person) Greet() {
	fmt.Printf("Hello, my name is %s and I am %d years old.\n", p.Name, p.Age)
}

// Define a method with a pointer receiver to modify the struct
func (p *Person) HaveBirthday() {
	p.Age++
	fmt.Printf("%s just had a birthday! New age: %d\n", p.Name, p.Age)
}

func main() {
	// Create a struct instance
	person1 := Person{
		Name: "Bob",
		Age:  25,
		City: "New York",
	}
	fmt.Println("Person 1:", person1)
	person1.Greet()

	// Accessing struct fields
	fmt.Printf("%s lives in %s.\n", person1.Name, person1.City)

	// Pointers example
	x := 10
	ptrX := &x // ptrX now holds the memory address of x
	fmt.Printf("\nValue of x: %d, Address of x: %p\n", x, ptrX)
	fmt.Printf("Value at ptrX: %d\n", *ptrX) // Dereference ptrX to get the value

	*ptrX = 20 // Change the value at the memory address
	fmt.Printf("New value of x: %d\n", x)

	// Using a method with a pointer receiver
	fmt.Println("\nBefore birthday:", person1)
	person1.HaveBirthday() // Go automatically handles &person1 for method calls
	fmt.Println("After birthday:", person1)
}
```

## ðŸ“… Day 6: Concurrency (Goroutines & Channels)

Go's superpower! Today you'll get a taste of Go's built-in concurrency primitives.

### âœ… Content:


- **Concurrency vs. Parallelism:** Understanding the difference.
  - Goroutines: Lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime.
  - Starting a goroutine using the go keyword.
  - The main goroutine.
- **Channels:** Type-safe conduits for communicating between goroutines.
  - Creating channels (make(chan type)).
  - Sending (<-chan) and receiving (chan<-) data from channels.
  - Buffered vs. unbuffered channels.
- **sync.WaitGroup:** A mechanism to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish.

### ðŸ’» Example Code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

// A function to be run as a goroutine
func worker(id int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done() // Decrement the counter when the goroutine finishes
	fmt.Printf("Worker %d starting...\n", id)
	time.Sleep(time.Second) // Simulate some work
	fmt.Printf("Worker %d finished.\n", id)
}

// A function to send messages through a channel
func sender(ch chan string) {
	ch <- "Hello from sender!" // Send a message to the channel
}

// A function to receive messages from a channel
func receiver(ch chan string) {
	msg := <-ch // Receive a message from the channel
	fmt.Printf("Received: %s\n", msg)
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println("--- Goroutines with WaitGroup ---")
	var wg sync.WaitGroup // Create a WaitGroup

	for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)       // Increment the counter for each goroutine
		go worker(i, &wg) // Start a goroutine
	}
	wg.Wait() // Wait for all goroutines to finish
	fmt.Println("All workers finished.")

	fmt.Println("\n--- Channels ---")
	messageChannel := make(chan string) // Create an unbuffered channel of strings

	go sender(messageChannel)    // Start a goroutine to send
	go receiver(messageChannel) // Start a goroutine to receive

	// Give goroutines time to execute (in a real app, you'd use sync primitives)
	time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)

	// Buffered channel example
	bufferedChannel := make(chan int, 2) // Buffered channel with capacity 2
	bufferedChannel <- 1
	bufferedChannel <- 2
	fmt.Println("\nReceived from buffered channel:", <-bufferedChannel)
	fmt.Println("Received from buffered channel:", <-bufferedChannel)
	close(bufferedChannel) // It's good practice to close channels when done sending
}
```

## ðŸ“… Day 7: Practical Project & Next Steps

Today is about consolidating your knowledge by building a small, practical Go application and understanding where to go next.



### âœ… Content:


- **Building a Simple Command-Line Application:** Apply all the concepts learned into a coherent project.
  - Example Project: A simple Task Manager CLI (Command Line Interface).
    - Features: Add task, list tasks, mark task as complete.
    - This will involve structs, slices, functions, basic I/O, and possibly error handling.
- **Recommended Next Steps:**
  - Explore Go's standard library.
  - Learn about packages and modules for organizing larger projects.
  - Dive deeper into interfaces and composition.
  - Practice building more complex applications.
  - Consider contributing to open-source Go projects.

### Example Project: Simple Task Manager CLI
This example will demonstrate a basic task manager where you can add and list tasks. Expanding on this would be a great practice!  


```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
)

// Task struct to represent a single task
type Task struct {
	ID        int
	Desc      string
	Completed bool
}

var tasks []Task // Global slice to store tasks
var nextID = 1    // Global counter for task IDs

func main() {
	reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)

	fmt.Println("--- Simple Go Task Manager ---")
	for {
		fmt.Println("\nOptions:")
		fmt.Println("1. Add Task")
		fmt.Println("2. List Tasks")
		fmt.Println("3. Exit")
		fmt.Print("Choose an option: ")

		input, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
		input = strings.TrimSpace(input)

		switch input {
		case "1":
			addTask(reader)
		case "2":
			listTasks()
		case "3":
			fmt.Println("Exiting Task Manager. Goodbye!")
			return
		default:
			fmt.Println("Invalid option. Please try again.")
		}
	}
}

// addTask prompts the user for a task description and adds it to the list
func addTask(reader *bufio.Reader) {
	fmt.Print("Enter task description: ")
	desc, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
	desc = strings.TrimSpace(desc)

	if desc == "" {
		fmt.Println("Task description cannot be empty.")
		return
	}

	newTask := Task{
		ID:        nextID,
		Desc:      desc,
		Completed: false,
	}
	tasks = append(tasks, newTask)
	nextID++
	fmt.Println("Task added successfully!")
}

// listTasks prints all current tasks
func listTasks() {
	if len(tasks) == 0 {
		fmt.Println("No tasks yet. Add some!")
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("\n--- Your Tasks ---")
	for _, task := range tasks {
		status := "[ ]"
		if task.Completed {
			status = "[X]"
		}
		fmt.Printf("%s ID: %d - %s\n", status, task.ID, task.Desc)
	}
	fmt.Println("--------------------")
}

// Example of how you might extend this with a 'Mark Complete' function (not integrated into main loop)
func markTaskComplete(taskID int) {
	for i := range tasks {
		if tasks[i].ID == taskID {
			tasks[i].Completed = true
			fmt.Printf("Task %d marked as complete.\n", taskID)
			return
		}
	}
	fmt.Printf("Task with ID %d not found.\n", taskID)
}

// Example of how you might extend this with a 'Delete Task' function (not integrated into main loop)
func deleteTask(taskID int) {
    for i, task := range tasks {
        if task.ID == taskID {
            // Remove the task from the slice
            tasks = append(tasks[:i], tasks[i+1:]...)
            fmt.Printf("Task %d deleted.\n", taskID)
            return
        }
    }
    fmt.Printf("Task with ID %d not found.\n", taskID)
}
```
